<p>
GoVolunteer is an application designed to connect volunteers with opportunities. We provide a space in which event organizers can share information about their events with a diverse group of volunteers - and we want you to join us! 
</p>
<p>
As a volunteer, you’ll have access to the collection of exciting events in your community and beyond. You can search by keyword for events that suit your interests and apply to volunteer for them, all through the GoVolunteer platform. We save the events you’re interested in and provide easy access to review the event details and find additional events in the same area or of the same type - or both! It’s easy to volunteer using GoVolunteer.
</p>
<p>
As an organizer, you’ll be able to connect with volunteers who have a wide range of interests and skill sets. GoVolunteer brings volunteers to your events and helps them sign up. You can share an image, event details, and a description of each event. We save your events to your organization profile page, which volunteers can access to find more events hosted by you. It’s a great way to maintain connections with volunteers who like working with you - everybody wins!</p>
