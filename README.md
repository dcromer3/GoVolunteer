Known bugs and defects 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Organization profile page, which is directed from the title link on registerEvent.html, is just hardcoded html page for now because we has not set up for organization’s profile on our database separately from volunteer side. 
Uploading image file for organization has been in process. So, the image file on events posted by organizations or on organization’s profile is empty for now. 

Although those two functions are not our major functions as well as not mentioned in our iteration plan, it might be necessary for user’s convenience in future.

Customer

Navigate to https://github.com/dcromer3/GoVolunteer. Scroll to the green button on the right side of the page that says “Clone or Download”; click the button. You will be presented with the option to Open in Desktop or Download ZIP. Select “Download ZIP”. The repository will be downloaded to your computer in a .zip file format. Unzip the folder by right-clicking and opening with the appropriate program, which will depend on your OS. Once the folder has completed the unzipping process, navigate into the “GoVolunteer-master” directory newly created. It should appear next to the .zip file. Perform an FTP transfer of the files in the GoVolunteer-master directory to the server of your choice to host the website.

End User

The end user will have no need to download any software or application to access the project’s services. Once the website has been transferred to the customer’s server, the end user will access the product by navigating to the url at which the server is hosting the product. This url will need to be provided by the customer upon completion of the file transfer.

Build instructions (if needed): 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
if you are providing the raw source code rather than a binary build, how will the customer and users create the required executable application? 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation of actual application: 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--After the software is downloaded from github, and the Amazon Web Services have been configured properly including the API, 

--the ajax requests must be changed in each of the javascript files to include the new AWS Links. 

--Then the software must be transferred via ftp to the server. 

--The domain must be setup to point to the web hosting server. 

--It is recommended you speak with your support group for the hosting service you use, as the instructions can vary wildly depending on the hosting service.
